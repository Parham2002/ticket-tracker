This is my Ticket Tracker project. 

It displays cards depending on the number of objects provided in an array from a data file, and also by clicking on the addition button.
Each card contains a counter that can be both incremented and decremented using the add/deduce buttons respectively. Each counter keeps track of its own individual number and does not interfere with other counters. Number of the counter also cannot go below 0.

I created this project through the use of tools and methods including but not limited to: React extenstion, JSX, SCSS, functions, arrays, objects, useState, object destructuring, and child/parent components.

If I had more time to spend on this project, I would:
1. Improve the code allowing new cards to be added through the button click
2. Add a search/filter option on the page
3. Improve aesthetics/ do more styling
4. Add more pseudocode to code
4. Make it so that the newly created cards allow inputs for name and role of the employee
5. Add a remove option for cards
